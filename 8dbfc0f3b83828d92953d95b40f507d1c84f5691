      "message": "This line needs to be solved.  This will only work for a OPNFV scenario, it will not allow a platform that is not an OPNFV developed platform to support DPDK.   (not to mention fd.io also uses DPDK so this will break even for OPNFV scenarions)\n\nMaybe we can move to an environment configuration file approach or equivalent (even args would do).  There should be no dependancies to OPNFV specific tools or build conventions in dovetail.",
