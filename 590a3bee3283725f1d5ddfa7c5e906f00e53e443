Are we expecting there to be subdirs under the result_dir too, or just logs?\n\nIf no subdirs, then we could drop the -r flag (recursive), which at least makes this a bit safer.\n\nAlso, instead of running a direct shell command, shouldn\u0027t we use a more generic interface like shutil, or even glob and loop over the files to drop them?",
