It is important to make a distinction between CVP testing and OpenStack interop testing otherwise what value are we adding here? We have already had questions about this and doubts expressed which can undermine the perceived value of CVP.",

See line 70.\n(2) Georg\u0027s change here is per Ildiko/openstack request that we replace \"defcore\" with \"OpenStack Interoperability test\". Since defcore is no longer used in openstack, i think it\u0027s reasonable thing to do.",

The Project-Name/Test naming is applied when only a portion of functions in that project (as in the case for Functest and Yardstick). Other projects do not have this ambiguity issue. Just to capture some of the history and rational. I suggest we move on in the non-essential issues in the interests of time. And we may have some experience to know better and improve next time around.",
