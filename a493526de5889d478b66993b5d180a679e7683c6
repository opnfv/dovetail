      "message": "I saw that, but the problem is that there is not \u0027encode\u0027 method in the python3, but only in python2. If use just the decode method and not the encode, the unit test will generate an error like this one [1]. As far as I have checked this, the only way to play both of them (the functionality and the unit test), is the update that I have uploaded (with the drawback which you have mentioned and without this drawback to appeared in the dovetail.log file, but just in the screen while you are running the test scenario)\n\n[1]  AttributeError: \u0027str\u0027 object has no attribute \u0027decode\u0027\n\nIf you have any idea to play without the \u0027b\u0027 in the screen printout and the unit tests to be run normally, please share it with me and I will update the patch accordingly.",
