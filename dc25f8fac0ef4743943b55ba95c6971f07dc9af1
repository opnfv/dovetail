      "message": "Yeah, this is a good suggestion.\nHowever, the structure of all these test cases are a little different. For example,\nha, ipv6, vping, sdnvpn are the same and the section \u0027short name\u0027 is almost the test case name you mentioned.\nosinterop and tempest are a little different so I just added a little description in the \u0027test area structure\u0027 section.\nSo it is a little difficult to add a section \u0027test case name\u0027 to all docs.\nBut I will still keep your suggestion in my mind and try to find a better way to do this maybe next version.",
