      "message": "It seems clear for the case of an API response including additional parameters, however, with this feature enabled, what would happen if a response was missing a parameter?  Will the test pass still (assuming that parameter was not required for the specific test function, i.e. to do something).  That would seem like very very dangerous behavior to allow to claim certification.",

      "message": "This is being taken care of by Tempest. The implementation of this command line option in Dovetail sets a specific field in the various schema definitions in Tempest (called \"additionalProperties\") from False to True. As a consequence, Tempest allows additional properties in API responses.\n\nConversely, the schema explicitly defines \"required\" fields. If those are missing, the test would still fail. See for example this schema:\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack/tempest/blob/master/tempest/lib/api_schema/response/compute/v2_1/availability_zone.py\n\nThere are separate schemas for different Nova API responses.",
