      "message": "valid question. The reason is that the OPNFV-specific SDNVPN tests are already numbered from 1 to 13 [1] and more tests will likely be written in the future. We have followed this numbering already for the SDNVPN tests in OVP1.0.0 [2]. Now, I wanted to avoid a clash in the numbering to avoid confusion. Hence, I chose 000.\n\nIn general, it is a like hard right now to determine the content of a TC based on its name. Hence, we could also use a string like \"dovetail.sdnvpn.tempest-api\" and apply a similar naming to the other test cases as well. Other suggestions are welcome, too.\n\n[1] https://github.com/opnfv/sdnvpn/tree/master/sdnvpn/test/functest\n[2] https://github.com/opnfv/dovetail/blob/master/dovetail/compliance/ovp.1.0.0.yml",

      "message": "The pre_condition basically restricts the tempest tests being executed to the API tests only, skipping the scenario tests which have been less stable. From an OVP perspective, I\u0027d like to include (pick) the stable API tests only, while leaving the scenario tests untouched in the SDNVPN repo. I can discuss with Peri if we want to split both tests sets in the SDNVPN project for Fraser and include them a separate test cases in Functest. For Euphrates, we might want to use this \"hack\" to avoid changes in Functest.",

However, I just want run a subset of the tests (only API) which have been integrated already. The pre_condition actually restricts the total number of tests to only those tests whose name includes api. I hope this clarifies it. please let me know if I misunderstood you.",
