      "message": "valid question. The reason is that the OPNFV-specific SDNVPN tests are already numbered from 1 to 13 [1] and more tests will likely be written in the future. We have followed this numbering already for the SDNVPN tests in OVP1.0.0 [2]. Now, I wanted to avoid a clash in the numbering to avoid confusion. Hence, I chose 000.\n\nIn general, it is a like hard right now to determine the content of a TC based on its name. Hence, we could also use a string like \"dovetail.sdnvpn.tempest-api\" and apply a similar naming to the other test cases as well. Other suggestions are welcome, too.\n\n[1] https://github.com/opnfv/sdnvpn/tree/master/sdnvpn/test/functest\n[2] https://github.com/opnfv/dovetail/blob/master/dovetail/compliance/ovp.1.0.0.yml",
