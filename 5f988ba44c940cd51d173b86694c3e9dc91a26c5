I meant that the description states that something line \"the VM images according to the user guide need to be available\", but you don\u0027t need to add the exact versions here. This, a user should get from the testing user guide.\n\nMoreover, if you name the flavors here, it seems as if they need to be created before the test. Instead, what Louie meant is that the system under test needs to be capable enough to create and run these flavors. You can add a sentence to clarify this.",
