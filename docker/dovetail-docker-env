# several ways to set Dovetail Docker container parameters
# 1.adjust these parameters according to the SUT, here is just an example
# 2.using openstack creds file
#   2.1 not transfer envs when creating dovetail container in run-in-container script,
#   which means delete line "--env-file dovetail-docker-env \" in run-in-container script,
#   add "-v </path/creds>:</path/creds>", then run "run-in-container -r"
#   2.2 when want to run dovetail testsuite, using "docker cp" to copy
#   the creds file on the openstack host to the container, can also using "touch" to create
#   an openstack "creds" file inside the container, whose path is "</path/creds>",
#   then on the host to run:
#   "run-in-container dovetail run --creds </path/creds>"
