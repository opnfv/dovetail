These tests in this spec then make up a piece of a larger test suite for ipv6 which would address additional areas.\nI guess what I\u0027m saying is I don\u0027t think this current approach is what we need for dovetail.  And we should identify what we need and then embark on the work to get the ipv6 tests in that structure and sequence.",
