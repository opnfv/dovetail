      "message": "This is the Functest CI filter which restricts one test case to be executed on some installers with/without some special scenarios. It has nothing to do with the test cases themselves. It\u0027s only because that some installers or some scenarios don\u0027t support this test case.\nFor Dovetail, it has no such concepts (installer or scenario), so I suggest to set them to be blank which means allow this test case to be always executed whatever the installer or scenario is.",
