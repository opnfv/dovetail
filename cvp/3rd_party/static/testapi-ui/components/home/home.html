        </ul>

            <p>Please email the completed application using the primary contact email account in order to establish identity.</p>
	-->

            <p>Once the application information is received and in order, an email response will be sent to the primary contact with confirmation and next step information.</p>

        <h2>Step 2: Testing</h2>
        <p>The following documents guide testers to prepare the test environment and run tests:</p>

        <ul>
	    <li><a href="http://artifacts.opnfv.org/dovetail/docs/testing_user_systempreparation/index.html">System Requirements and Preparation Guide for OPNFV CVP </a></li>
            <li><a href="http://artifacts.opnfv.org/dovetail/docs/testing_developer_testscope/index.html">OPNFV CVP Teslt Case Specification </a></li>
            <li><a href="http://artifacts.opnfv.org/dovetail/docs/testing_user_userguide/index.html">Dovetail Test Tool User Guide </a></li>
        </ul>
	<!--
            <p>[Editor's note: The above three documents are still work in progress. Names and references will be corrected when they are merged.]</p>

            <p>A unique Test ID is generated by the Dovetail tool for each test run. Please take a note of this ID for future reference.</p>
	-->

        <hr>
        <h2>Step 3: Submitting Test Results</h2>
            <p>Testers can login to the CVP web portal <a href="https://cvp.opnfv.org">https://cvp.opnfv.org</a> with the LF ID or Openstack ID and upload the test results. By default, the results are visible only to the user who uploaded the data.</p>

	<!--
            <p>[Editor's note: the web portable URL is a placeholder and will be replaced once the actual URL is implemented.]</p>
	-->

            <p>Testers can self-review the test results through the portal until they are ready to ask for CVP review. They may also update with or add new test results as needed.</p>

            <p>Once the tester is satisfied with the test result, the tester grants access to the test result for CVP review via the portal. The test result is identified by the unique Test ID.</p>

            <p>Notify via the official CVP email address that a review request has been made and reference the Test ID. This will alert the C&C Committee to start the CVP review process.</p>

        <hr>
        <h2>Step 4: CVP Review</h2>
            <p>Upon receiving the email notification and the Test ID, the C&C Committee conducts a peer based review of the test result. Persons employed by the same organization that submitted the test results or by affiliated organizations should not be part of the reviewers.</p>

            <p>The primary contact may be asked via email for any missing information or clarification of the application. The reviewers will make a determination and recommend to the C&C Committee. Normally, the outcome of the review should be communicated to the tester within 10 business days after all required information is in order.</p>

            <p>If an application is denied, an appeal can be made to the C&C Committee or ultimately to the Board of Directors of OPNFV.</p>

        <hr>
        <h2>Step 5: Grant of Use of Logo</h2>
        <p>If an application is approved, further information will be communicated to the tester on the guidelines of using OPNFV logos for promotional purposes.</p>
