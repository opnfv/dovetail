      "message": "Actually there is a reason. In case the developer wants to test a new feature, by this way he can build an image with BRANCH\u003dgerrit/ref/change to include his change.\n\nWhen you pip install directly, pip cannot handle ref/changes as a BRANCH. Or it can but I do not know how.\n\nBecause I tried to do it and I could not.\n\nQuestion: Why the soft link or even the code is actually needed to be at /home/opnfv/dovetail after pip installing?",
