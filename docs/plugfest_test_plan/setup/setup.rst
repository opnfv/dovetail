Plugfest setup and configuration
================================

.. This directory includes files and information for the test
.. equipment, setup, configuration, and other general items that apply
.. to multiple test cases.

.. The setup.rst file organises and imports the relevant RST files in this
.. directory and includes them in the overall plugfest documentation.

We can add some general text here introducing the setup and configuration
before digging into the details of each of the necessary sub chapters.
