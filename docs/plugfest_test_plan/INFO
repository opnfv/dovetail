This directory contains the test plan being developed by the OPNFV Dovetail 
project team for the plugfest test events.  The test plan is broken up into
files containing its individual sections to allow developers to easily 
collaborate, without causing collisions.

Developer Guidelines
1. Please check with a project leader before creating a new directory.
2. The content is ordered by the corresponding inclusions in the index.rst
   file and associated collation files.
3. The RST format has been selected to provide a file format that 
   allows the inclusion of figures, pictures, and tables while maintaining
   clear text contribution for the documents and toolchain support.
