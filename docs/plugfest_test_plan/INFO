This directory contains the test plan being developed by the OPNFV Dovetail 
project team for the plugfest test events.  The test plan is broken up into
files containing its individual sections to allow developers to easily 
collaborate, without causing collisions.

Developer Guidelines
1. Please check with a project leader before creating a new directory.
2. Please use a number scheme for file names to logical order the files as 
   the document should read when a “natural sort” operation is applied.
3. The LibreOffice format has been selected to provide a file format that 
   allows the inclusion of figures, pictures, and tables.  Please keep all 
   files in this format, or as a raw text file.
