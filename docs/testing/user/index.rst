Introduction
============

This document provides all relevant user documentation for executing the OPNFV
compliance and certification program (CVP).  The CVP provides mechanisms for evaluating
NFV infrastructures to establish their alignment with the target architectures, behaviours
and functions defined by the OPNFV community.

Compliance and Verification Program guidelines
==============================================

The CVP provides publicly available mechanisms for evaluating compliance to OPNFV concepts,
behaviours and architectures.  The CVP, through the Compliance and Certification
committee, is responsible for evaluating the results of any evaluations and providing
access to any associated OPNFV branding.  Details of the CVP are described in the `CVP Document.`_

Compliance and Verification program test specification
======================================================

The `test specification`_ provides an outline of the prerequisites, methods, tools
& areas that are applicable to the CVP test process.  The `test specification`_ is intended
to give a use a comprehensive overview of what is expected of engineer prior to running
the NFV platform evaluation suite, what tools and processes will be used during the
evaluation and a guide as to how the results of the tests will be interpreted.  It is advised
that all practitioners of the CVP read the `test specification`_ prior to beginning
the process of evaluation.

Compliance and Verification program Test Plan
=============================================

The test spec will outline the processes & areas and the test case descriptions included.
This document will in addition outline how to modularise the areas to be executed, how to
run each area and when the testing process begins and ends.

Compliance and Verification program Test results
================================================

To be added once our test result reporting system and processes are defined.
