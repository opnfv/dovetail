VIM image operations test specification
=======================================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

Scope
=====

The VIM image test area evaluates the ability of the system under test to support
VIM image operations. The test cases documented here are the Image API test cases
in the Openstack Interop guideline 2016.8 as implemented by the Refstack client.
These test cases will evaluate basic Openstack (as a VIM) image operations including
image creation, image list, image update and image deletion capabilities using Glance v2 API.

References

Definitions and abbreviations
=============================

The following terms and abbreviations are used in conjunction with this test area

- API - Application Programming Interface
- CRUD - Create, Read, Update, and Delete
- NFVi - Network Functions Virtualization infrastructure
- VIM - Virtual Infrastructure Manager

System Under Test (SUT)
=======================

The system under test is assumed to be the NFVi and VIM in operation on a
Pharos compliant infrastructure.

Test Area Structure
====================

The test area is structured based on VIM image operations. Each test case is able
to run independently, i.e. irrelevant of the state created by a previous test.

For brevity, the test cases in this test area are summarized together based on
the operations they are testing.

Basic test flow execution description and pass/fail criteria
------------------------------------------------------------

Test execution
''''''''''''''

* Test action 1: Create 6 images and store their ids in a created images list.
* Test action 2: Use image v2 API to show image schema and check the body of the response.
* **Test assertion 1:** In the body of the response, the value of the key 'name' is 'image'.
* Test action 3: Use image v2 API to show images schema and check the body of the response.
* **Test assertion 2:** In the body of the response, the value of the key 'name' is 'images'.
* Test action 4: Create an image with name 'test', container_formats 'bare' and
  disk_formats 'raw'. Delete this image with its id and then try to show it with
  its id. Delete this deleted image again with its id and check the API's response code.
* **Test assertion 3:** The operations of showing and deleting a deleted image with its id
  both get 404 response code.
* Test action 5: Use a null image id to show a image and check the API's response code.
* **Test assertion 4:** The API's response code is 404.
* Test action 6: Generate a random uuid and use it as the image id to show the image.
* **Test assertion 5:** The API's response code is 404.
* Test action 7: Delete the 6 images with the stored ids. Show all images and check
  whether the 6 images' ids are not in the show list.
* **Test assertion 6:** The 6 images' ids are not found in the show list.

Pass / fail criteria
''''''''''''''''''''

The first two test cases evaluate the ability to use Glance v2 API to show image
and images schema. The latter three test cases evaluate the ability to use Glance
v2 API to show images with a deleted image id, a null image id and a non-existing
image id. Specifically it verifies that:

* Glance image get API can show the image and images schema.
* Glance image get API can't show an image with a deleted image id.
* Glance image get API can't show an image with a null image id.
* Glance image get API can't show an image with a non-existing image id.

In order to pass this test, all test assertions listed in the test execution above need to pass.
