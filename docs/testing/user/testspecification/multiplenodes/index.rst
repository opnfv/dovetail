VM Resource Scheduling on Multiple Nodes test specification
===========================================================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

Scope
=====

The VM resource scheduling test area evaluates the ability of the system under
test to support VM resource scheduling on multiple nodes.
The tests in this test area will evaluate capabilities to schedule VM to multiple
compute nodes directly with scheduler hints, and create server groups with policy
affinity and anti-affinity.

References
==========

- Availability zone

  - https://docs.openstack.org/newton/networking-guide/config-az.html

- Scheduling

  - https://docs.openstack.org/kilo/config-reference/content/section_compute-scheduler.html

Definitions and abbreviations
=============================

The following terms and abbreviations are used in conjunction with this test area

- API - Application Programming Interface
- NFVi - Network Functions Virtualization infrastructure
- VIM - Virtual Infrastructure Manager
- VM - Virtual Machine

System Under Test (SUT)
=======================

The system under test is assumed to be the NFVi and VIM in operation on a
Pharos compliant infrastructure.

Test Area Structure
===================

The test area is structured based on server group operations and server operations
on multiple nodes. Each test case is able to run independently, i.e. irrelevant of
the state created by a previous test. Specifically, every test performs clean-up
operations which return the system to the same state as before the test.

* One public network

Basic test flow execution description and pass/fail criteria
------------------------------------------------------------

Test execution
''''''''''''''

* Test action 1: Get all availability zones AZONES1 in the SUT
* Test action 2: Get all compute nodes in AZONES1
* Test action 3: Get the value of 'min_compute_nodes' which is set by user in tempest
  config file and means the minimum number of compute nodes expected
* **Test assertion 1:** Verify that SUT has at least as many compute nodes as
  specified by the 'min_compute_nodes' threshold
* Test action 4: Create one server for each compute node, up to the 'min_compute_nodes' threshold
* **Test assertion 2:** Verify the number of servers matches the 'min_compute_nodes' threshold
* Test action 5: Get every server's 'hostId' and store them in a set which has no duplicate values
* **Test assertion 3:** Verify the length of the set equals to the number of servers to ensure
  that every server ended up on a different host
* Test action 6: Delete the created servers
