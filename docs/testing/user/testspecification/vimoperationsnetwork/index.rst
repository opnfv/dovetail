VIM network operations test specification
=========================================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

Scope
=====

The VIM network test area evaluates the ability of the system under test to support
VIM network operations. The test cases documented here are the network API test cases
in the Openstack Interop guideline 2016.8 as implemented by the Refstack client.
These test cases will evaluate basic Openstack (as a VIM) network operations including
basic CRUD operations on L2 networks, L2 network ports and security groups.

References
==========

- OpenStack Interoperability guidelines (version 2016.08)

  - https://github.com/openstack/interop/blob/master/2016.08.json

- Refstack client

Definitions and abbreviations
=============================

The following terms and abbreviations are used in conjunction with this test area

- API - Application Programming Interface
- CRUD - Create, Read, Update and Delete
- NFVi - Network Functions Virtualization infrastructure
- VIM - Virtual Infrastructure Manager

System Under Test (SUT)
=======================

The system under test is assumed to be the NFVi and VIM in operation on a
Pharos compliant infrastructure.

Test Area Structure
====================

The test area is structured based on VIM network operations. Each test case is able
to run independently, i.e. irrelevant of the state created by a previous test.
Specifically, every test performs clean-up operations which return the system to
the same state as before the test.

For brevity, the test cases in this test area are summarized together based on
the operations they are testing.

Note: the latter 18 test cases are the alias of the former first 18, respectively.
Alias should always be included so that the test run will be tempest version agnostic,
which can be used to test different version of Openstack.
