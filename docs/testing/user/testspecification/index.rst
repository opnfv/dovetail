Introduction
============

The OPNFV CVP provides a series or test areas aimed to evaluate the operation of an
NFV system in accordance with carrier networking needs.  Each test area conatins a number
of associated test cases which are descrobed in detail in the associated test specification.

All tests in the CVP are required to fulfill a specific set of criteria in order that the
CVP is able to provide a fair assesment of the system under test.  Test requierements are
described in the 'Test Case Requierements'_ document.

All tests areas addressed in the CVP are covered in the following test specification documents.
