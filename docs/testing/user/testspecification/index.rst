Introduction
============

The OPNFV OVP provides a series or test areas aimed to evaluate the operation
of an NFV system in accordance with carrier networking needs.  Each test area
contains a number of associated test cases which are described in detail in the
associated test specification.

All tests in the OVP are required to fulfill a specific set of criteria in
order that the OVP is able to provide a fair assessment of the system under
test.  Test requirements are described in the :ref:dovetail-test_case_requirements
document.

All tests areas addressed in the OVP are covered in the following test
specification documents.
