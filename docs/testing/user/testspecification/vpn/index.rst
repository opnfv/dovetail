   :maxdepth: 2

Scope
=====

The VPN test area evaluates the ability of the system under test to support VPN
networking for virtual workloads.  The tests in this test area will evaluate
establishing VPN networks, publishing and communication between endpoints using
BGP and tear down of the networks.

References
==========

This test area evaluates the ability of the system to perform selected actions
defined in the following specifications. Details of specific features evaluated
are described in the test descriptions.

- RFC 4364 - BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks

  - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4364

- RFC 4659 - BGP-MPLS IP Virtual Private Network

  - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4659

- RFC 2547 - BGP/MPLS VPNs

  - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2547


Definitions and abbreviations
=============================

The following terms and abbreviations are used in conjunction with this test
area

- BGP - Border gateway protocol
- eRT - Export route target
- IETF - Internet Engineering Task Force
- iRT - Import route target
- NFVi - Network functions virtualization infrastructure
- Tenant - An isolated set of virtualized infrastructures
- VM - Virtual machine
- VPN - Virtual private network
- VLAN - Virtual local area network


System Under Test (SUT)
=======================

The system under test is assumed to be the NFVi and VIM in operation on a
Pharos compliant infrastructure.


Test Area Structure
===================

The test area is structured in four separate tests which are executed
sequentially. The order of the tests is arbitrary as there are no dependencies
across the tests. Specifially, every test performs clean-up operations which
return the system to the same state as before the test.

The test area evaluates the ability of the SUT to establish connectivity
between Virtual Machines using an appropriate route target configuration,
reconfigure the route targets to remove connectivity between the VMs, then
reestablish connectivity by re-association.


Test Descriptions
=================

----------------------------------------------------------------
Test Case 1 - VPN provides connectivity between Neutron subnets
----------------------------------------------------------------

Short name
----------

opnfv.sdnvpn.subnet_connectivity


Use case specification
----------------------

This test evaluates the use case where an NFVi tenant uses a BGPVPN to provide
connectivity between VMs on different Neutron networks and subnets that reside
on different hosts.


Test preconditions
------------------

2 compute nodes are available, denoted Node1 and Node2 in the following.


Basic test flow execution description and pass/fail criteria
------------------------------------------------------------

Methodology for verifying connectivity
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Connectivity between VMs is tested by sending ICMP ping packets between
selected VMs. The target IPs are passed to the VMs sending pings by means of a
custom user data script. Whether or not a ping was successful is determined by
checking the console output of the source VMs.


Test execution
''''''''''''''

* Create Neutron network N1 and subnet SN1 with IP range 10.10.10.0/24
* Create Neutron network N2 and subnet SN2 with IP range 10.10.11.0/24

Pass / fail criteria
''''''''''''''''''''

This test evaluates the capability of the NFVi and VIM to provide routed IP
connectivity between VMs by means of BGP/MPLS VPNs. Specifically, the test
verifies that:

* VMs in the same Neutron subnet have IP connectivity regardless of BGP/MPLS
  VPNs (test assertion 1, 2, 4)

* VMs in different Neutron subnets do not have IP connectivity by default - in
  this case without associating VPNs with the same import and export route
  targets to the Neutron networks (test assertion 3)

* VMs in different Neutron subnets have routed IP connectivity after
  associating both networks with BGP/MPLS VPNs which have been configured with
  the same import and export route targets (test assertion 5, 6). Hence,
  adjusting the ingress and egress route targets enables as well as prohibits
  routing.

In order to pass this test, all test assertions listed in the test execution
above need to pass.

Test Case 2 - VPNs ensure traffic separation between tenants
------------------------------------------------------------

opnfv.sdnvpn.tenant_separation


Use case specification
----------------------

IP ranges can be used.

2 compute nodes are available, denoted Node1 and Node2 in the following.


Basic test flow execution description and pass/fail criteria
------------------------------------------------------------

Methodology for verifying connectivity
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Connectivity between VMs is tested by establishing an SSH connection. Moreover,
the command "hostname" is executed at the remote VM in order to retrieve the
hostname of the remote VM. The retrieved hostname is furthermore compared
against an expected value. This is used to verify tenant traffic separation,
i.e., despite overlapping IPs, a connection is made to the correct VM as
determined by means of the hostname of the target VM.
