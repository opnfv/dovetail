Security Group and Port Security test specification
===================================================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

Scope
=====

The security group and port security test area evaluates the ability of the
system under test to support packet filtering by security group and port security.
The tests in this test area will evaluate preventing MAC spoofing by port security,
basic security group operations including testing cross/in tenant traffic, testing
multiple security groups, using port security to disable security groups and
updating security groups.

References

N/A

Definitions and abbreviations
=============================

The following terms and abbreviations are used in conjunction with this test
area

- API - Application Programming Interface
- ICMP - Internet Control Message Protocol
- MAC - Media Access Control
- NFVi - Network Functions Virtualization infrastructure
- SSH - Secure Shell
- TCP - Transmission Control Protocol
- VIM - Virtual Infrastructure Manager
- VM - Virtual Machine

System Under Test (SUT)
=======================

The system under test is assumed to be the NFVi and VIM in operation on a
Pharos compliant infrastructure.

Test Area Structure
===================

The test area is structured based on the basic operations of security group and
port security. Each test case is able to run independently, i.e. irrelevant of
the state created by a previous test. Specifically, every test performs clean-up
operations which return the system to the same state as before the test.

All these test cases are included in the test case dovetail.tempest.network_security of
OVP test suite.
