   :maxdepth: 2

Scope
=====

The HA test area evaluates the ability of the System Under Test to support service
continuity and recovery from component failures on part of OpenStack controller services("nova-api",
"neutron-server", "keystone", "glance-api", "cinder-api") and on "load balancer" service.

The tests in this test area will emulate component failures by killing the
processes of above target services, stressing the CPU load or blocking
disk I/O on the selected controller node, and then check if the impacted
services are still available and the killed processes are recovered on the
selected controller node within a given time interval.

Yardstick test case: opnfv_yardstick_tc019.yaml

Use case specification
----------------------

This test case verifies the service continuity capability in the face of the
software process failure. It kills the processes of OpenStack "nova-api"
service on the selected controller node, then checks whether the "nova-api"
service is still available during the failure, by creating a VM then deleting

time interval.


Test preconditions
------------------

There is more than one controller node, which is providing the "nova-api"
service for API end-point.

Denoted a controller node as Node1 in the following configuration.


Basic test flow execution description and pass/fail criteria
------------------------------------------------------------

Methodology for verifying service continuity and recovery
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The service continuity and process recovery capabilities of "nova-api" service
is evaluated by monitoring service outage time, process outage time, and results
of nova operations.

Service outage time is measured by continuously executing "openstack server list"
command in loop and checking if the response of the command request is returned
with no failure.
When the response fails, the "nova-api" service is considered in outage.
The time between the first response failure and the last response failure is
considered as service outage time.

Process outage time is measured by checking the status of "nova-api" processes on
the selected controller node. The time of "nova-api" processes being killed to
the time of the "nova-api" processes being recovered is the process outage time.
Process recovery is verified by checking the existence of "nova-api" processes.

All nova operations are carried out correctly within a given time interval which
suggests that the "nova-api" service is continuously available.

Basic test flow execution description and pass/fail criteria
------------------------------------------------------------

Methodology for monitoring high availability
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The high availability of related OpenStack service is evaluated by monitoring service
outage time

Service outage time is tested by continuously executing "openstack router list",
"openstack stack list", "openstack volume list", "openstack image list" commands
in loop and checking if the response of the command request is returned with no
failure.
When the response fails, the related service is considered in outage. The time
between the first response failure and the last response failure is considered
as service outage time.


Methodology for stressing CPU usage
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To evaluate the high availability of target OpenStack service under heavy CPU
load, the test case will first get the number of logical CPU cores on the
target controller node by shell command, then use the number to execute 'dd'
command to continuously copy from /dev/zero and output to /dev/null in loop.
The 'dd' operation only uses CPU, no I/O operation, which is ideal for
stressing the CPU usage.

Since the 'dd' command is continuously executed and the CPU usage rate is
stressed to 100%, the scheduler will schedule each 'dd' command to be
processed on a different logical CPU core. Eventually to achieve all logical
CPU cores usage rate to 100%.

Test execution

* Test action 1: Start four monitors: one for "openstack image list" command,
  one for "openstack router list" command, one for "openstack stack list"
  command and the last one for "openstack volume list" command. Each monitor
  will run as an independent process.
* Test action 2: Connect to Node1 through SSH, and then stress all logical CPU
  cores usage rate to 100%

OpenStack command is OK and the killed processes are recovered.

Test preconditions
------------------

In this test case, an attacker called "kill-process" is needed.
This attacker includes three parameters: fault_type, process_name and host.

The purpose of this attacker is to kill any process with a specific process

database connection of different OpenStack components.

For second monitor is used a process monitor and the main purpose is to watch
whether the database processes on the host node are killed properly.

Therefore, in this test case, there are two metrics:

* service_outage_time, which indicates the maximum outage time (seconds)
  of the specified OpenStack command request
* process_recover_time, which indicates the maximum time (seconds) from the
  process being killed to recovered

outage time.
Process recovery is verified by checking the existence of processes of
"messaging queue" service.

Test execution
''''''''''''''

* Test action 1:  Start five monitors: one for processes of "messaging queue"
  service and the others for "openstack image list", "openstack network list",
  "openstack stack list" and "openstack volume list" command. Each monitor
  will run as an independent process
* Test action 2: Connect to Node1 through SSH, and then kill all the processes of
  "messaging queue" service
* Test action 3: Continuously measure service outage time from the monitors until
  the service outage time is more than 5s
* Test action 4: Continuously measure process outage time from the monitor until
  the process outage time is more than 30s

Pass / fail criteria
''''''''''''''''''''

Test passes if the process outage time is no more than 30s and
the service outage time is no more than 5s.

A negative result will be generated if the above is not met in completion.

Post conditions
---------------
Restart the processes of "messaging queue" if they are not running.

Test Case 11 - Controller node OpenStack service down - Controller Restart
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Short name
----------

yardstick.ha.controller_restart

Yardstick test case: opnfv_yardstick_tc025.yaml

Use case specification
----------------------

This test case verifies that the high availability of controller node is working
properly.
Specifically, this test case shutdowns a specified controller node via IPMI,
then checks whether all services provided by the controller node are OK with
some monitor tools.

Test preconditions
------------------

In this test case, an attacker called "host-shutdown" is needed.
This attacker includes two parameters: fault_type and host.

The purpose of this attacker is to shutdown a controller and check whether the
services are handled by this controller are still working normally.

Basic test flow execution description and pass/fail criteria
------------------------------------------------------------

Methodology for verifying service continuity and recovery
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

In order to verify this service one monitor is going to be used.

This monitor is using an OpenStack command and the respective command name of
the OpenStack component that we want to verify that the respective service is
still running normally.

In this test case, there is one metric: 1)service_outage_time: which indicates
the maximum outage time (seconds) of the specified OpenStack command request.

Test execution
''''''''''''''
* Test action 1: Connect to Node1 through SSH, and check that controller services
  are running normally
* Test action 2: Start monitors: each monitor will run as independently
  process, monitoring the image list, router list, stack list and volume list accordingly.
  The monitor info will be collected.
* Test action 3: Using the IPMI component, the Node1 is shut-down remotely.
* Test action 4: Stop monitors after a period of time specified by "waiting_time".
  The monitor info will be aggregated.
* Test action 5: Verify the SLA and set the verdict of the test case to pass or fail.


Pass / fail criteria
''''''''''''''''''''

Check whether the SLA is passed:
- The process outage time is less than 30s.
- The service outage time is less than 5s.

The controller operations are carried out in above order and no errors occur.

A negative result will be generated if the above is not met in completion.

Post conditions
---------------

The controller has been restarted

Test Case 12 - OpenStack Controller Virtual Router Service High Availability
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Short name
----------

yardstick.ha.neutron_l3_agent

Yardstick test case: opnfv_yardstick_tc058.yaml

Use case specification
----------------------

This test case will verify the high availability of virtual routers(L3 agent)
on controller node. When a virtual router service on a specified controller
node is shut down, this test case will check whether the network of virtual
machines will be affected, and whether the attacked virtual router service
will be recovered.

Test preconditions
------------------

There is more than one controller node, which is providing the Neutron API
extension called "neutron-l3-agent" virtual router service API.

Denoted as Node1 in the following configuration.

Basic test flow execution description and pass/fail criteria
------------------------------------------------------------

Methodology for verifying service continuity and recovery
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The high availability of "neutrol-l3-agent" virtual router service is evaluated
by monitoring service outage time and process outage time.

Service outage is tested using ping to virtual machines. Ping tests that
the network routing of virtual machines is ok.
When the response fails, the virtual router service is considered in outage.
The time between the first response failure and the last response failure is
considered as service outage time.

Process outage time is tested by checking the status of processes of "neutron-l3-agent"
service on the selected controller node. The time of those processes being
killed to the time of those processes being recovered is the process outage time.

Process recovery is verified by checking the existence of processes of
"neutron-l3-agent" service.

Test execution
''''''''''''''
* Test action 1: Two host VMs are booted, these two hosts are in two different
  networks, the networks are connected by a virtual router.
* Test action 2: Start monitors: each monitor will run with independently process.
  The monitor info will be collected.
* Test action 3: Do attacker: Connect the host through SSH, and then execute the kill
  process script with param value specified by “process_name”
* Test action 4: Stop monitors after a period of time specified by “waiting_time”
  The monitor info will be aggregated.
* Test action 5: Verify the SLA and set the verdict of the test case to pass or fail.

Pass / fail criteria
''''''''''''''''''''

Check whether the SLA is passed:
- The process outage time is less than 30s.
- The service outage time is less than 5s.

A negative result will be generated if the above is not met in completion.

Post conditions
---------------

Delete image with "openstack image delete neutron-l3-agent_ha_image".

Delete flavor with "openstack flavor delete neutron-l3-agent_ha_flavor".
