Dynamic Network Runtime Operations test specification
=====================================================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

Scope
=====

The dynamic network runtime operations test area evaluates the ability of the
system under test to support dynamic network runtime operations through the
life of a VNF (e.g. attach/detach, enable/disable, read stats).
The tests in this test area will evaluate IPv4 network runtime operations
functionality. These runtime operations includes hotpluging network interface,
detaching floating-ip from VM, attaching floating-ip to VM, updating subnet's
DNS, updating VM instance port admin state and updating router admin state.

References

Definitions and abbreviations
=============================

The following terms and abbreviations are used in conjunction with this test
area

- API - Application Programming Interface
- DNS - Domain Name System
- ICMP - Internet Control Message Protocol
- MAC - Media Access Control
- NIC - Network Interface Controller
- NFVi - Network Functions Virtualization infrastructure
- SSH - Secure Shell
- TCP - Transmission Control Protocol
- VIM - Virtual Infrastructure Manager
- VM - Virtual Machine

System Under Test (SUT)
=======================

The system under test is assumed to be the NFVi and VIM in operation on a
Pharos compliant infrastructure.

Test Area Structure
===================

The test area is structured based on dynamic network runtime operations. Each
test case is able to run independently, i.e. irrelevant of the state created by
a previous test. Specifically, every test performs clean-up operations which
return the system to the same state as before the test.

  incoming SSH and ICMP traffic
* Test action 2: Create a neutron network NET1
* Test action 3: Create a tenant router R1 which routes traffic to public network
* Test action 4: Create a subnet SUBNET1 and add it as router interface

* **Test assertion 2:** Ping the internal gateway from VM1 successfully
* **Test assertion 3:** Ping the default gateway from VM1 using its floating IP
  FIP1 successfully
* Test action 6: Detach FIP1 from VM1
* **Test assertion 4:** VM1 becomes unreachable after FIP1 disassociated
* Test action 7: Create a new server VM2 with NET1, and associate floating IP FIP1 to VM2

Pass / fail criteria
''''''''''''''''''''

This test evaluates the functionality of basic network operations.
Specifically, the test verifies that:

* The Tempest host can ping VM's IP address. This implies, but does not
  guarantee (see the ssh check that follows), that the VM has been assigned the
  correct IP address and has connectivity to the Tempest host.

* The Tempest host can perform key-based authentication to an ssh server hosted
  at VM's IP address. This check guarantees that the IP address is associated
  with the target VM.

* The Tempest host can ssh into the VM via the IP address and successfully ping
  the internal gateway address, implying connectivity to another VM on the same network.

* The Tempest host can ssh into the VM via the IP address and successfully ping
  the default gateway, implying external connectivity.

* Detach the floating-ip from the VM and VM becomes unreachable.

* Associate attached floating ip to a new VM and the new VM is reachable.

* Floating IP status is updated correctly after each change.

In order to pass this test, all test assertions listed in the test execution above need to pass.
