opnfv.ipv6.dualnet_slaac

Use case specification
----------------------

This test case evaluates IPv6 address assignment in ipv6_ra_mode 'slaac' and
ipv6_address_mode 'slaac'.
In this case, guest instance obtains IPv6 address from OpenStack managed radvd
using SLAAC. This test case then verifies the ping6 available VM can ping the other
VM's v4 address in one network and v6 address in another network as well as the
v6 subnet's gateway ip, the reference is
