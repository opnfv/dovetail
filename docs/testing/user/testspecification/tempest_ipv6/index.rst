IPv6 test specification
========================

Scope
=====

The IPv6 test area will evaluate the ability for a SUT to support IPv6
Tenant Network features and functionality. The tests in this test area will
evaluate,

- network, subnet, port, router API CRUD operations
- interface add and remove operations
- security group and security group rule API CRUD operations
- IPv6 address assignment with dual stack, dual net, multiprefix in mode DHCPv6 stateless or SLAAC

References
================

- upstream openstack API reference

  - https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/

- upstream openstack IPv6 reference

  - https://docs.openstack.org/newton/networking-guide/config-ipv6.html

Definitions and abbreviations
=============================

The following terms and abbreviations are used in conjunction with this test area

- API - Application Programming Interface
- CIDR - Classless Inter-Domain Routing
- CRUD - Create, Read, Update, and Delete
- DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
- DHCPv6 - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6
- ICMP - Internet Control Message Protocol
- NFVI - Network Functions Virtualization Infrastructure
- NIC - Network Interface Controller
- RA - Router Advertisements
- radvd - The Router Advertisement Daemon
- SDN - Software Defined Network
- SLAAC - Stateless Address Auto Configuration
- TCP - Transmission Control Protocol
- UDP - User Datagram Protocol
- VM - Virtual Machine
- vNIC - virtual Network Interface Card

System Under Test (SUT)
=======================

The system under test is assumed to be the NFVI and VIM deployed with a Pharos compliant infrastructure.

Test Area Structure
====================

The test area is structured based on network, port and subnet operations. Each test case
is able to run independently, i.e. irrelevant of the state created by a previous test.
