----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Short name

functest.tempest.ipv6_scenario.dhcpv6_stateless

Use case specification
----------------------

This test case evaluates IPv6 address assignment in ipv6_ra_mode 'dhcpv6_stateless'
and ipv6_address_mode 'dhcpv6_stateless'.
In this case, guest instance obtains IPv6 address from OpenStack managed radvd
using SLAAC and optional info from dnsmasq using DHCPv6 stateless. This test case then
verifies the ping6 available VM can ping the other VM's v4 and v6 addresses
as well as the v6 subnet's gateway ip in the same network, the reference is

Test preconditions
------------------

There should exist a public router or a public network.
