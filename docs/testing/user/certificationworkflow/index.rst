================================================================
OPNFV Compliance Verification Program certification workflow
================================================================

Introduction
============

This document provides guidance for testers on how to obtain OPNFV compliance
certification. The OPNFV Compliance Verification Program (CVP) is administered by
the OPNFV Compliance and Certification (C&C) committee.

For further information about the workflow and general inquiries about the
program, please check out the `CVP web portal`_, or contact
the C&C committee by email address cvp@opnfv.org. This email address should be used
for all communication with the CVP.

Step 1: Applying
================

A tester should start the process by completing an application.
The application form can found on the `CVP web portal`_ and the following
information should be provided:

- Organization name
- Organization website (if public)
- Product name and/or identifier
- Product specifications
- Product public documentation
- Product categories, choose one: (i) software and hardware (ii) software
  and third party hardware (please specify)
- Primary contact name, business email, postal address and phone number
  Only the primary email address should be used for
  official communication with OPNFV CVP.
- User ID for CVP web portal
  The CVP web portal supports the Linux Foundation user ID in the current release.
  If a new user ID is needed, visit https://identity.linuxfoundation.org.
- Location where the verification testing is to be conducted. Choose one:
  (internal vendor lab, third-party lab)
- If the test is to be conducted by a third-party lab, please specify
  name and contact information of the third-party lab, including email, address and
  phone number.

Please email the completed application using the primary contact email
account in order to establish identity.

Once the application information is received and in order, an email response will be
sent to the primary contact with confirmation and information to proceed.

[Editor's note:
No fee has been established at this time for CVP applications. Recommend
we skip fee for the initial release of CVP.]

Step 2: Testing
===============

The following documents guide testers to prepare the test environment and run tests:

- :ref:`dovetail-system_preparation_guide`
- :ref:`dovetail-test_case_specification`
- :ref:`dovetail-testing_user_guide`

A unique Test ID is generated by the Dovetail tool for each test run. Please take a note
of this ID for future reference.

Step 3: Submitting Test Results
===============================

Testers can upload the test results to the `CVP web portal`_.
By default, the results are visible only to the tester who uploaded the data.

Testers can self-review the test results through the portal until they are ready to ask
for CVP review. They may also update with or add new test results as needed.

Once the tester is satisfied with the test result, the tester grants access to the test result
for CVP review via the portal. The test result is identified by the unique Test ID.

When a test result is made visible to the reviewers, the web portal will notify
cvp@opnfv.org and Cc the primary contact email that a review request has been made and reference
the Test ID. This will alert the C&C Committee to start the CVP review process.

Step 4: CVP Review
===================

Upon receiving the email notification and the Test ID, the C&C Committee conducts a
peer based review of the test result. Persons employed by the same organization that submitted
the test results or by affiliated organizations will not be part of the reviewers.

The primary contact may be asked via email for any missing information or
clarification of the application. The reviewers will make a determination and recommend
compliance or non-compliance to
the C&C Committee. Normally, the outcome of the review should be communicated
to the tester within 10 business days after all required information is in order.

If an application is denied, an appeal can be made to the C&C Committee or ultimately to the
Board of Directors of OPNFV.

Step 5: Grant of Use of Logo
============================

If an application is approved, further information will be communicated to the tester
on the guidelines of using OPNFV CVP logos and the status of compliance for promotional purposes.
