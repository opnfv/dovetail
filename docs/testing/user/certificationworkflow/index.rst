OVP Workflow
============

Introduction
============

This document provides guidance for prospective participants on how to
obtain "OPNFV Verified" for products and services. The OPNFV
Verification Program (OVP) is administered by the LF Networking
Compliance and Verification (C&V) Committee.

For further information about the workflow and general inquiries about
the program, please check out the `OVP landing page`_, or contact the
C&V committee by email address verified@opnfv.org. This email address
should be used for all communication with the OVP.

Step 1: Participation Form Submission
=====================================

A participant should start the process by submitting an online
participation form. The participation form can be found on the `OVP
landing page`_. Submitters are asked for the following information:

- Organization name
- Contact name
- Contact address
- Contact telephone
- Contact email
- Membership status in LF Networking
- Qualifying Offerings Information
- Testing Category
- Product Category
- User ID
- Version of Testing Tools
- Testing Date
- Testing Location
- Third-party lab information (if any)
- Signature

Once the participation form information is received and in order, an
email response will be sent to the primary contact with confirmation and
information to proceed. The primary contact specified in the
participation form will be entered into the corresponding OVP web portal
back-end by the program administrator and will be permitted to submit
results for review on behalf of their organization. The OVP NFVI Portal
can be found here (https://nfvi-verified.lfnetworking.org) and the OVP
VNF Portal can be found here (https://vnf-verified.lfnetworking.org).

There is no fee at this time for participation in the OVP for LF
Networking (LFN) members or non-profit organizations. If not a member of
LFN, please contact `LF Networking`_ for participation fee information.

Step 2: Testing
===============

The following documents guide testers to prepare the test environment and run tests:

- :ref:`dovetail-system_preparation_guide`
- :ref:`dovetail-test_case_specification`
- :ref:`dovetail-testing_user_guide`

A unique Test ID is generated by the Dovetail tool for each test run and can only be
submitted to the OVP web portal once.

Step 3: Submitting Test Results
===============================

Users/testers other than the primary contact may use the OVP web portal as a resource to upload,
evaluate and share results in a private manner. Testers can upload the test results to the
OVP web portal (either NFVI or VNF). By default, the results are visible only to the tester who uploaded the data.

Testers can self-review the test results through the portal until they are ready to ask
for OVP review. They may also add new test results as needed.

Once the tester is satisfied with the test result, the primary contact grants access to the test
result for OVP review using a 'submit for review' operation via the portal. During this step,
a new window may be appeared to ask primary contact to complete the application form online.
Then the test result is identified by the unique Test ID and becomes visible to a review group
comprised of OPNFV community members.

When a test result is made visible to the reviewers, the program administrator will ask for
volunteers from the review group using the verified@opnfv.org email and CC the primary contact
email that a review request has been made. The program administrator will supply the Test ID
and owner field (primary contact user ID) to the reviewers to identify the results.

Step 4: OVP Review
===================

Upon receiving the email request from the program administrator, the review group conducts a
peer based review of the test result using reviewer guidelines published per OVP release.
Persons employed by the same organization that submitted the test results or by affiliated
organizations will not be part of the reviewers.

The primary contact may be asked via email for any missing information or clarification of the
test results. The reviewers will make a determination and recommend compliance or non-compliance
to the C&V Committee. A positive review requires a minimum of two approvals from two distinct
organizations without any negative reviews. The program administrator sends an email to OVP/C&V
emails announcing a positive review. A one week limit is given for issues to be raised. If no
issue is raised, the C&V Committee approves the result and the program administrator sends an
email to OVP/C&V emails stating the result is approved.

Normally, the outcome of the review should be communicated to the primary contact within 10
business days after all required information is in order.

If a test result is denied, an appeal can be made to the C&V Committee for arbitration.

Step 5: Grant of Use of Program Marks
=====================================

If an application is approved, further information will be communicated to the primary contact
that includes badges and on the guidelines of using OVP Program Marks for marketing and promotional purposes.
