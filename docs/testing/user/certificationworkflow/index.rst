Introduction

This document provides guidance for testers on how to obtain OPNFV compliance certification.

An :ref:`application form <cvp-application-form>` is provided for initiating the certification process and includes questions relating
to the system being tested as well as the test environment.

For further infomation about the workflow and general enquiries about the certification program please contact
the CVP committee using <mailto:cvpenquiries@opnfv.org>

Submitting the CVP application form

Application SLA and escalation process

Following the Test Procedure
============================
The following documents guide testers/users to prepare the test environment and run tests:

  - System requirements and preparation guide

  - Test Case Specification (a reference of all test cases organized by platform capability)

  - Test Case Description (for each test case)

  - Dovetail Test Tool user guide

Submitting Test Results for Verification
========================================
Once complete you should have your results ready to upload to the CVP repository, you can upload
them according to "a guide that should be added here". Once uploaded you will be able to review and
submit your results for evaluation.

---------------------------
Self-review of test results
---------------------------
Once you have completed your CVP testing you should have your results ready to upload.  You can
upload your results "in some way" for your personal review and eventual submission.

Here we should describe the way a tester reviews their results prior to submitting to ensure the
results presented in the CVP repository are accurate according to the testers expectation prior to
submission.

-----------------------------------------
Granting reviewers access to test results
-----------------------------------------
When you are satisfied with your uploaded test results you can submit them for review by the CVP
review committee.  The process for doing this "should be described here".

----------------------------
Communication with reviewers
----------------------------
Your submission will be sent to a review committee.  If a reviewer needs to contact you for
clarification or further information they will do so by means of the contact information you
provided in your :ref:`application form <cvp-application-form>`.

--------------
Submission SLA
--------------
I guess we have something to describe here.  We should really have the tools in place before trying
to answer what this would look like.

--------------
Appeal process
--------------

Describe how to appeal a decision.

------------------
Escalation process
------------------

Describe the escalation process if your appeal is unsuccessful.
