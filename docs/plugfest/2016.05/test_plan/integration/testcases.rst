Dovetail integration test cases
===============================

.. This file includes test cases for testing integration
.. between the OPNFV platform and network equipment (i.e. SDN Controllers,
.. Routers, etc.).

.. The setup.rst file organises and imports the relevant RST files in this
.. directory and includes them in the overall plugfest documentation.

We can add some general text here around the integration test cases.
The test case descriptions should likely be organised as single rst
files in this directory that are imported below the toctree command below.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   ./testcase1.rst
   ./testcase2.rst
   ./testcase_etc.rst
