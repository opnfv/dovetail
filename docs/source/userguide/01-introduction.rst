Dovetail_ is an OPNFV Project.

This project intends to define and provide a set of OPNFV related validation
criteria that will provide input for the evaluation of the use of OPNFV trademarks.
The dovetail project will be executed with the guidance and oversight of the Compliance
and Certification committee and work to secure the goals of the C&C committee for each release.

This project intends to incrementally define qualification criteria
that establish the foundations of how we are able to measure the ability
to utilize the OPNFV platform, how the platform itself should behave,
and how applications may be deployed on the platform.
