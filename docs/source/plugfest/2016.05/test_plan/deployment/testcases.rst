Dovetail deployment test cases
==============================

.. This file includes the test cases specific to the OPNFV deployment testing.

.. The setup.rst file organises and imports the relevant RST files in this
.. directory and includes them in the overall plugfest documentation.

We can add some general text here around the deployment test cases.
The test case descriptions should likely be organised as single rst
files in this directory that are inported below the toctree command below.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   ./testcase1.rst
   ./testcase2.rst
