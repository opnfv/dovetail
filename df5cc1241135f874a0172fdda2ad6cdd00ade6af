Reference components may be used as part ... , these components where used will be described in the test specification.\n\n(It is important that if we are using a derived product as part of the test harness that this is described in the context of the test case itself.  API\u0027s and interfaces may be able to be described in a common way, however their behavior differs by implementation. If we will support one implementation over a \"generic framework or stub\" this should be clearly documented for the tester.\nThis should likely be added to the \"acceptance criteria\" for any tests to be used in the CVP.",
