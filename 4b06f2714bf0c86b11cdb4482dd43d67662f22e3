      "message": "This is much clearer, I assume each release the term of \"applicable\" in a release in the context of the CVP is something the TSC will need to make a statement on.  For Danube I assume it\u0027s an \"all released scenario\u0027s\" scope for the pre-requisite.\nThat requires more detail than we should have in this requirements doc, although it needs to be captured somewhere.  Not a straightforward question imho.\n\nBut this amendment is good as a clarification of the requirements.",
