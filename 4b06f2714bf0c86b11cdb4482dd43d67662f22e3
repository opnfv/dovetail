      "message": "This is much clearer, I assume each release the term of \"applicable\" in a release in the context of the CVP is something the TSC will need to make a statement on.  For Danube I assume it\u0027s an \"all released scenario\u0027s\" scope for the pre-requisite.\nThat requires more detail than we should have in this requirements doc, although it needs to be captured somewhere.  Not a straightforward question imho.\n\nBut this amendment is good as a clarification of the requirements.",

      "message": "If \"applicable\" means \"applicable to the test cases in question\", we may be able to make a clear statement. E.g. k8t-*-* are not applicable because k8t is now out of scope. We are also not directly testing ODL, so os-odl-* are also not applicable... if we go down this route, it seems we end up with os-nosdn-nofeature-ha only for being mandatory. Any other way of interpreting applicability?\n\nBtw, imho, \"scenario\" and \"release\" are poor qualifiers at this time since they are still poorly defined and insufficient to serve as a measure of quality or maturity for our purpose.",
