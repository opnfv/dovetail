      "message": "If this is a proposal for the IPv6 test spec the naming of the test cases needs to be more explicit.  I suggest starting with the target SUT implementation, the target feature suite , then the specific use cases being tested.  Something like os-ipv6-crd would best describe this test case.",

      "message": "Naming is a clerical or administrative issue. Certainly the clerical and administrative issue needs to be addressed later on when all test cases including IPv6, L3VPN, SFC etc are all developed in order to have a more consistent way of naming across all test cases in Dovetail. Thus this comment is out of scope of the intention of this patch. And it has nothing to do with any technical issue of IPv6 tests. This comment is not a gating factor.",

      "message": "Repeating my previous response here. OPNFV is a carrier-grade, integrated, open source platform. The architecture and components of OPNFV platform is available in home page and wiki page, and marketed in various occasions in industry. Certainly, like any technical work, certain level technical knowledge of OPNFV platform is a prerequisite for those who intends to work on technical aspects of OPNFV including compliance testing. Even if a definition or other documentation of OPNFV Platform is indeed needed to serve educational purpose, it should be addressed in TSC. Thus this comment is out of scope of the intention of this patch. And it has nothing to do with any technical issue of IPv6 tests. This comment is not a gating factor.",

      "message": "I agree with Chris here - is there a specific scenario, or set of prerequisites, needed? Do we even need to talk about an OPNFV-based platform? Could this be removed entirely, and replaced with \"This test, and other tests in the test suite, are designed to verify an entire SUT, and not any individual component of the system\"? If the SUT passes the test suite, it will be, by definition, an OPNFV compatible system.",
