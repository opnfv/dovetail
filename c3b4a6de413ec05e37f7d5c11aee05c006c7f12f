But it takes the Boolean value as a string file path and always reports that it failed to find the file \u0027True\u0027 or \u0027False\u0027.\nThen Cedric told me to set OS_VERIFY to be empty and it works.\nMaybe it\u0027s a bug of shade or os_client_config. I plan to dig into this problem later and get it back to the shade or os_client_config team.",
